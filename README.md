# Stainless neural networks in JAX

Inox is a minimal [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) library for neural networks with an intuitive PyTorch-like syntax. As with [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), modules are represented as PyTrees, which enables complex architectures, easy manipulations, and functional transformations.

Inox aims to be a leaner version of [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) by only retaining its core features: PyTrees and lifted transformations. In addition, Inox takes inspiration from other projects like [NNX](https://github.com/cgarciae/nnx) and [Serket](https://github.com/ASEM000/serket) to provide a versatile interface.

## Installation

The `inox` package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/inox), which means it is installable via `pip`.

```
pip install inox
```

Alternatively, if you need the latest features, you can install it from the repository.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/francois-rozet/inox
```

## Getting started

Modules are defined with an intuitive PyTorch-like syntax,

```python
import jax
import inox.nn as nn

init_key, data_key = jax.random.split(jax.random.key(0))

class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, key):
        keys = jax.random.split(key, 3)

        self.l1 = nn.Linear(3, 64, key=keys[0])
        self.l2 = nn.Linear(64, 64, key=keys[1])
        self.l3 = nn.Linear(64, 3, key=keys[2])
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def __call__(self, x):
        x = self.l1(x)
        x = self.l2(self.relu(x))
        x = self.l3(self.relu(x))

        return x

model = MLP(init_key)
```

and are compatible with JAX transformations.

```python
X = jax.random.normal(data_key, (1024, 3))
Y = jax.numpy.sort(X, axis=-1)

@jax.jit
def loss_fn(model, x, y):
    pred = jax.vmap(model)(x)
    return jax.numpy.mean((y - pred) ** 2)

grads = jax.grad(loss_fn)(model, X, Y)
```

However, if a tree contains strings or boolean flags, it becomes incompatible with JAX transformations. For this reason, Inox provides lifted transformations that consider all non-array leaves as static.

```python
model.name = 'stainless'

@inox.jit
def loss_fn(model, x, y):
    pred = inox.vmap(model)(x)
    return jax.numpy.mean((y - pred) ** 2)

grads = inox.grad(loss_fn)(model, X, Y)
```
